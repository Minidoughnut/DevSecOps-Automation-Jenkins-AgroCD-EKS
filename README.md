## Introduction
![Introduction](path_to_your_image/introduction.png)

This project aims to provide a robust and secure CI/CD pipeline that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying applications. By incorporating security measures at every stage, this pipeline ensures that the applications are not only efficiently deployed but also secure.

## Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](path_to_your_image/architecture_diagram.png)

The CI/CD pipeline follows a microservices architecture with the following components:
1. **Source Code Management** *(Git and GitHub)*:
2. **Continuous Integration:** Jenkins
3. **Build Management:** Maven
4. **Testing:** JUnit
5. **Static Code Analysis:** SonarQube
6. **Artifact Management:** JFrog Artifactory
7. **Containerization:** Docker
8. **Container Security:** Trivy
9. **Cloud Storage:** AWS S3
10. **Container Registry:** Docker Hub
11. **Kubernetes Management:** EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
12. **Continuous Deployment:** ArgoCD
13. **Monitoring:** Prometheus and Grafana
14. **Notifications:** Slack
15. **Secrets Management:** HashiCorp Vault
